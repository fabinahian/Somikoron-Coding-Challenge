# Data Science Intern Interview Coding Challenge Solutions

Welcome to my repository containing solutions to the coding challenges I completed as part of an at-home assessment for a data science internship position. Below are the details of the problems solved:

## Problem 1: Basic Data Structure

### Description:
The problem involved analyzing the profit of eight divisions of XYZ Company over three years.

### Steps Taken:
1. Created separate lists for eight divisions and three years' profits.
2. Formed a tuple using the resulting lists.
3. Converted the tuple to a dictionary.
4. Made a DataFrame from the dictionary and set the index as Year1, Year2, Year3.
5. Visualized the DataFrame using a horizontal bar plot.

## Problem 2: Basic NLP - Bangla

### Description:
This problem focused on creating a Bag of Words from a Bangla paragraph.

## Problem 3: Web Scraping for Book Information

### Description:
The task involved scraping book names, writers, book texts, and genres from a series of web pages.

### Additional Notes:
- For the Book Text column, only the text from the first page was extracted, and pagination was not considered.
- Each book might have multiple genres, which were captured in the Genre column.
- The final dataframe was structured to include information from all scraped pages, resulting in 95 rows for 95 books.
